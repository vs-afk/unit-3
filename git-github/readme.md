Git Lesson,
version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005,
allows multiple developers to contribute to the same codebase,
that codebase or project is called a repository (repo for short),

First Time Git Setup,
to see your git config, use the command git config --global --list,
to set your username, use git conifg user.name --global "first last",
to set your email, use git config user.email --global "email@here.com",

How to use Git,
in the folder in which you intend to create a project initialize a new git repository,
initialize a new repository using git init command,
to check the status of the repository, use git status command,
in order to track files, use git add <name of file> to track a file
if you want to add all of the files at once, use git add .,
,
if you would like to unstage a file, you can use git rm --cached <name of file> to do so,
if you are ready to commit, use the git commit -m "your commit message here" command,
git log will show you a history of your commits,

Git Lingo,
branch - a timeline of your code at any given point,
the default branch is called the main branch or master,
commit - a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time,
commit message - a message describing changes in your commit,
